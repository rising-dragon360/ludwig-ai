## Do you support \[feature | encoder | decoder\] in Ludwig?

The list of encoders for each feature type is specified in the [User Guide](user_guide.md).
We plan to add additional feature types and additional encoders and decoders for all feature types.
Refer to [this question](#what-additional-features-are-you-working-on) for more details.
If you want to help us implementing your favourite feature or model please take a look at the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md) to see how to contribute.


## Do all datasets need to be loaded in memory?

At the moment it depends on the type of feature: image features can be dynamically loaded from disk from an opened hdf5 file, while other types of features (that usually take need less memory than image ones) are loaded entirely in memory for speed. We plan to add an option to load also other features from disk in future releases and to also support more input file types and more scalable solutions like [Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/Petastorm).


## What additional features are you working on?

We will prioritize new features depending on the feedback of the community, but we are already planning to add:

- additional text and sequence encoders (attention, co-attention, hierarchical attention, [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)).
- additional image encoders ([DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) and [FractalNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648)).
- image decoding (both image generation by deconvolution and pixel-wise classification for image segmentation).
- time series decoding.
- additional features types (audio / speech, geolocation, vectors, dates, point clouds, lists of lists, multi-sentence documents, graphs).
- additional measures and losses.
- additional data formatters and dataset-specific preprocessing scripts.

We also want to address some of the current limitations:

- currently the full dataset needs to be loaded in memory in order to train a model. Image features already have a way to dynamically read batches of datapoints from disk, and we want to extend this capability to other datatypes.
- it is currently not possible to serve automatically trained ludwig models, we want to add a small server and a simple user interface in order to provide a live demo capability.
- document lower level functions.
