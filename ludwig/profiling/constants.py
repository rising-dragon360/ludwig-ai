"""Constants for standard whylogs metrics.

By default, whylogs will track the following metrics according to the column's inferred data type:

Integral:
- counts
- types
- distribution
- ints
- cardinality
- frequent_items

Fractional:
- counts
- types
- cardinality
- distribution

String:
- counts
- types
- cardinality
- frequent_items

# The number of null values.

# The number of values consisting of a boolean.

# an object.

# Cardinality
# The estimated unique values for each feature
CARDINALITY_EST = "cardinality/est"
