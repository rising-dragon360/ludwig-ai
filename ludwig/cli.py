    """CLI describes a command line interface for interacting with Ludwig, there
    are several different functions that can be performed. These functions are:
    - experiment - run an experiment using ludwig
    - predict - Given a list of $hat{y}$ values, compute $d(\hat{y}, y) under a
      specified metric
    - train - trains a model on the input file specified to it
    - visualize - Analysis of the results for the model on the dataset and
      presents a variety of plots to understand and evaluate the results
    - collect_weights - Collects the weights for a pretrained model as a tensor
      representation
    - collect_activations - For each datapoint, there exists a corresponding
      tensor representation which are collected through this method
