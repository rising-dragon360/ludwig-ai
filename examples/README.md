# Examples
This directory contains example programs demonstrating Ludwig's Python APIs.

|Directory|Examples Provided|
|---------|-----------------|
|titanic|Trains a simple model with model definition contained in a yaml file.  Trains multiple models from yaml files and generate visualizations to compare training results.  Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to programmatically create visualizations.|
|mnist|Creates a model definition data structure from a yaml file and trains a model.  Programmatically modify the model definition data structure to evaluate several different neural network architectures.  Jupyter notebook demonstrates using a hold-out test data set to visualize model performance for alternative model architectures.|
|hperopt|Demonstrates using the [hyperopt package](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) with Ludwig to perform hyper-parameter optimization.|
